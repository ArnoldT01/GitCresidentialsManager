# Git Cresidentials Manager

- A simple Bash script for quickly updating your Git global username and email.
- Reason for Creating This Script: I encountered an issue where my repositories showed two contributors—both my accounts—due to having different global Git configurations on the same device. This script simplifies switching between accounts by updating Git details quickly, preventing the need to manually re-enter information.
